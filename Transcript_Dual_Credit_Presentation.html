  <h3>A freshman applicant is a current high school student (with or without college credit) or a high school graduate with no college credit earned after high school graduation. <em>reference: </em><a href="https://admissions.tamu.edu/apply/freshman">TAMU</a></h3>
  <ul>
  <li>You may apply as a freshman as long as your college coursework is designated as dual-credit.</li>
  <li>Dual-credit college credits transfer after you are accepted as a freshman.</li>
  <li>Once you take your first college course after high school graduation, you must apply as a transfer student.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Dual Credit Coursework significantly reduces the number of time you are in school to meet your educational goals and the amount of money you have to pay.</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Do you really want to take the same class twice?</li>
  <li>Entry level classes at a junior college are often far smaller than those at a large university and not considered "weed-out" classes.</li>
  <li>Compare the price tag between a year of dual credit coursework and state university after high school graduation 
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://tuition.tamu.edu/undergraduate">TAMU</a></li>
      <li>Dual-credit classes are significantly cheaper than local homeschool classes.</li>
      <li>From the Houston Community College website... "The Houston City College Board of Trustees has waived tuition and fees for dual credit students. Students living within taxing districts (In-District) may take dual credit classes at no charge. Students living outside of the taxing district (Out-of-District) do not pay tuition, but they do pay tuition out-of-district fees."</li>
      <li>Retaking a dual-credit class is not as financially painful as retaking a class at a university.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <h3>Speak to a dual-credit advisor at your chosen junior college.</h3>
  <h3>Find out the possible associates degrees your junior college offers dual-credit students.</h3>
  <h3>Choose a degree path and plug in that coursework to fill high school credits on a hypothetical transcript.</h3>
  <h3>Allow time on your transcript to retake a class, if needed.  Yes, this unfortunately happens.</h3>
  <h3>Find out the possible entrance exams and exam scores to be accepted into your chosen junior college.</h3>
  <h3>Apply to the junior college as a dual-credit student.</h3>
  <h3>Do not wait too long to register for classes.</h3>
  <h3>Make sure the classes you sign up for transfer!</h3>
  <ul><strong>Examples of classes my students have used to transfer.  Always double-check these courses still transfer and fulfill the credits you are looking for!</strong>

<h3>Sign up for the right professor too.</h3>
<h4><em>see <a href="https://www.ratemyprofessors.com">https://www.ratemyprofessors.com</a></em></h4>
  <h3>Pay fees and buy books on time.</h3>

  <h3>Graduating high school with an associates degree has many benefits:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Qualifies you for a job with higher pay and benefits faster.  This can be big.</li>
    <li>Helps to protect credits from having to be repeated.</li>
    <li>If the right courses were selected, all the credits will count towards a future degree reducing the time and cost of school.</li>
